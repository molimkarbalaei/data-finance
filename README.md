# ðŸ“£ **Summary**

This application (**Data-Finance website**) was built using _React_ (Custom Hooks).

---

I used Tailwind CSS for this project and I really enjoyed using it. I used styled components in my previous project, but I have now converted all my projects to Tailwind CSS for ease of use.
